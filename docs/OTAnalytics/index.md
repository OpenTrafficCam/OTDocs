# In a Nutshell

> Giving the data a meaning.

[**OTAnalytics**](https://github.com/OpenTrafficCam/OTAnalytics) is a set of self developed algorithms to gather traffic measures based on trajectories of road users.

Key features:

* Generation of traffic flow matrices and node flow diagrams
* Measurement of time gaps, velocities and accelerations
* Long-term: Analysis of near-accidents (e.g. TTC, PET)
* Visualization of traffic data
* Import of trajectories from other systems (e.g. DataFromSky)
* Runs on any Windows laptop

Most of the code will be developed by the OpenTrafficCam contributors (based on python libraries like [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) and [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)).
