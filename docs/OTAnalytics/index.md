# Features

> The **brain** of OpenTrafficCam.

[OTAnalytics](https://github.com/OpenTrafficCam/OTAnalytics) is a set of self-developed algorithms to gather traffic measures based on trajectories of road users. It provides a user-friendly graphical interface for configuring analyses, extracting valuable insights from your data, and exporting the results efficiently.

## Key features

* Configuration of traffic analyses using sections and flows
* Generation of traffic counts and flow matrices
* Export of event lists for detailed analysis
* Visualization of tracks, events, and traffic data
* Various visualization layers and filters
* Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Domain Elements

OTAnalytics works with the following key concepts:

* **Tracks**: Trajectories of road users, composed of a series of detections
* **Track Points**: Representative points from each bounding box, forming the trajectory
* **Sections**: Digital equivalents of physical detectors for traffic measurement
* **Events**: Generated when a track's trajectory intersects a section
* **Flows**: Traffic flows defined by a starting section and an ending section
* **Track Assignments**: Assignment of tracks to flows based on events

## Hardware Requirements

OTAnalytics runs on most modern desktop PCs and laptops (e.g., with an i5 processor and 8 GB of RAM).

* More RAM allows you to load more tracks of road users simultaneously
* A faster processor improves the runtime of analyses and makes the user interface more responsive

* [Usage UI](usage-ui.md): Detailed guide on how to use the graphical user interface

Most of the code is developed by the OpenTrafficCam contributors 
(based on Python libraries like [NumPy](https://numpy.org/),
[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/),
[tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)
and [PyAV](https://github.com/PyAV-Org/PyAV)).
