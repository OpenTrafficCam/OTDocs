# Features

> The **brain** of OpenTrafficCam.

[**OTAnalytics**](https://github.com/OpenTrafficCam/OTAnalytics) is a set of self developed algorithms to gather traffic measures based on trajectories of road users.

## Key features

* Generation of traffic flow matrices and node flow diagrams
* Measurement of time gaps, velocities and accelerations
* Long-term: Analysis of near-accidents (e.g. TTC, PET)
* Visualization of traffic data
* Import of trajectories from other systems (e.g. DataFromSky)
* Runs on any Windows laptop

## Content of documentation

<!-- TODO Create content, and add links to content pages, links to the software then on the content pages -->

Most of the code will be developed by the OpenTrafficCam contributors (based on python libraries like [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) and [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)).

!!! warning "Early prototype"

    The version of OTAnalytics described in this documentation is in early
    prototype stage. It is only tested on 64 bit Windows 10 machines.

    We are currently working on a stable release,
    which will also be tested Mac and Linux machines.
    
    Stay tuned :)
