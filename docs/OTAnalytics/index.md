# Features

> The **brain** of OpenTrafficCam.

[OTAnalytics](https://github.com/OpenTrafficCam/OTAnalytics) is a set of self developed algorithms to gather traffic measures based on trajectories of road users.

## Key features

* Generation of traffic flow matrices and node flow diagrams
* Measurement of time gaps, speeds and accelerations
* Long-term: Analysis of near-accidents (e.g. TTC, PET)
* Visualization of traffic data
* Import of trajectories from other systems (e.g. DataFromSky)
* Runs on any Windows laptop

## Content of documentation

<!-- TODO Create content, and add links to content pages, links to the software then on the content pages -->

Most of the code will be developed by the OpenTrafficCam contributors (based on python libraries like [NumPy](https://numpy.org/),
[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/),
[tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)
and [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)).

!!! warning "Early prototype"

    The currently available version of OTAnalytics described in this
    documentation is in early prototype stage.
    This version works and offers an impression of the functionality. Â 

    It is partially tested on Windows 10.

    We are currently working on a complete re-implementation
    for a stable release.
    It will also be tested on Mac and Linux.
    
    Stay tuned :)
