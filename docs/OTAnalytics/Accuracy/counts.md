# Traffic Counts

One of the main target of the OpenTrafficCam are traffic counts at junctions and route sections. But the traffic count results are only useful when the quality of the counts is high, or in detail, the sensitivity and accuracy with regard of the ground truth has to be high. In his diploma thesis Armin Kollascheck investigated the quality of the traffic counts that got generated by using YOLOv5x6 (Ultralytics) and a modified IOU-Tracker (Bochinski et al.) for eight realistic count scenarios. The results are shown in the table below. 

| traffic count scenario | KPZ 1 | KPZ 2 | KPZ 3 | KPZ 4 | KPZ 4 N | QSZ 1 | QSZ 2 | QSZ 2 N |
|------------------------|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-------:|:-----:|:-----:|:-------:|
| sensitivity            |  0.94 |  0.56 |  0.85 |  0.95 |   0.95  |  0.91 |  0.97 |   0.12  |
| accuracy               |  1.00 |  0.63 |  0.95 |  0.99 |   0.98  |  1.00 |  1.00 |   0.06  |

The high sensitivity and accuracy in many scenarios show the high potential of the used methodology. With unsatisfactory results for "KPZ 2" and "QSZ 2 N" we also can say, that the actual used methodology of the OpenTrafficCam is still not perfect. We need and want to improve OpenTrafficCam in the future to get useable traffic count results for difficult count scenarios.
