## Load Tracks 

The intuitive tkinter-based userinterface lets you easily:

* load and import videofiles from the most common formats such as mkv or mp4
* import output-file from [**OTVision**](https://github.com/OpenTrafficCam/OTVision) to display selected tracks and boundingboxes 
* play, rewind or scroll through video with mouse or slider
