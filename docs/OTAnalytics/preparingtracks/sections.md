# Sections

With [**OTAnalytics**](https://github.com/OpenTrafficCam/OTAnalytics) you can add sections and regions:

* simply drag and draw to create a linesection
* use mouseclick events to determine corner of a polygonregion
* created gates appear in an interactive listbox 

Created sections and regions can be used to calculate gatecrossing events with help of previously imported track-file from [**OTVision**](https://github.com/OpenTrafficCam/OTVision).
