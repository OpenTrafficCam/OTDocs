# Sections

OTAnalytics provide functions to lay down sections to analyse traffic flow and volume over time or traffic composition. Sections work as sensors which can detect crossing events and the direction of objects if driven over multiple sections. Sections can easily be modeled as line- or areadetectors. 



## Create and delete Sections

For a linesection simply toggle the linesection-button, click- and drag on canvas and press enter to define a sectionname. Areasections work almost simular. Leftclick to define boundaries and rightclick to close the polygon. Created sections will appear in the middle left listbox and can selected. Selected section wil be highlighted on canvas and can be deleted or renamed, saved and later imported.
