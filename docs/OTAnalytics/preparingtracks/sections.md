# Sections

OTAnalytics provide functions to lay down sections to analyse traffic flow and volume over time or traffic composition. Sections work as sensors which can detect crossing events and associated time and also the direction of objects if driven over multiple sections. Sections can easily be modeled as line- or areadetectors depending on your purpose. 


## Create and delete Sections

For a linesection simply toggle the linesection-Button, click- and drag your mouse over the canvas. Press enter to define a sectionname and finish the creationprocess. Areasections work almost simular. Leftclick to define boundaries and rightclick to automatically close the polygon. Created sections will appear in the middle left listbox. Selected section will be highlighted on canvas and can be deleted or renamed. If you want to continue your work you can ex- and later import a flow-file that contains information about sections and movements.
