# Movements

Movements represent traffic flows described by source-destination relationships
in your video footage.

## Create an delete Movements

Movements can be defined by clicking the "new movement" button and adding pre defined
sections while being selected.
Therefore movements can consist of infinite sections where the first section is the
source and the last section stands for the destination.

As sections, movements can be saved, renamed, deleted and imported.
They are saved as filetype `.otflow` in `JSON` format.
