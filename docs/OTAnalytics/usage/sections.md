# Define Sections

OTAnalytics provides functions to define sections for analyzing traffic flows at
specific locations in your video.
Sections work as sensors which can detect road userÂ´s crossing events
and their associated time.

## Create and Delete Sections

To create a section, click the "New" button, then click and drag your mouse over the
canvas.
Press enter to define a section name and finish the creation process.

Created sections will appear in the middle left listbox.
The selected section will be highlighted on canvas and can be deleted or renamed.

You can also save and load a section configuration.
They are saved as file type `.otflow` in `JSON` format.
