# First Use

## Load video

OTAnalytics provides a simple graphical user interface.
Your first step should be to load a video file in the most common formats (e.g. mp4)
by clicking on the "load video"-button.
The chosen filename will be inserted in the upper left listbox and a canvas with the
first videoframe will be created.
You can navigate through the video by either by scrolling, sliding or simply playing
the video.

## Load and select trajectories

With click on the "Load tracks"-button a dialogue window pops up which asks for a
tracks file from [**OTVision**](https://github.com/OpenTrafficCam/OTVision).
Here you have to select file with an `.ottrk` extension(zipped `JSON` format),
which corresponds to the video you loaded earlier.
This file contains framewise information about road users such as class, position,
and size.

After loading the tracks, the road users IDÂ´s and classes will be displayed a listbox.
The user interface also provides multiple options to display the tracks on the canvas:
all tracks as well as the

- You can display a single track or multiple tracks by selecting the road users IDs or
    you can display all tracks at once.
- You can display bounding boxes and tracks of the cars currently visible on the canvas

## Check trajectories

After importing all necessary files,
it is important to check if chosen data correspond to eachother.
The easiest way to do this, is to play, slide or scroll through the video.
If correct, bounding boxes should overlay vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists.
