# First Use

## Load Video

OtAnalytics provides a simple and classic Point-and-Click-Userinterface. Your first step should always be to load the previous processed videofile in the most common formats such as mkv or mp4. The chosen filename will be inserted in the upper left listbox and a canvas with the first videoframe will be created.


## Load and select Tracks

Import the output-file from [**OTVision**](https://github.com/OpenTrafficCam/OTVision) to display tracks and boundingboxes. The objects will appear in the listbox and can easily be selected via mouseclick. You can either select multiple objects or hit the "display all tracks" to see wanted tracks on the canvas.


## navigate through video

To plausibly if bounding boxes, tracks and video correspond to another you can scroll through the video via mousewheel or press the play/rewind-button. If correct, bounding boxes should overlay vehicles, pedestrians and cyclist.
