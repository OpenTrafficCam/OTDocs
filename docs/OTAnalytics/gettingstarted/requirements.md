# Requirements

## Hardware prerequisites

OTAnalytics runs on all modern desktops and laptops
(e.g. i5 processor and 8 GB RAM).

!!! warning "Early prototype"

    The currently available version of OTAnalytics described in this
    documentation is in early prototype stage.
    This version works and offers an impression of the functionality. Â 

    It is partially tested on Windows 10.

    We are currently working on a complete re-implementation
    for a stable release.
    It will also be tested on Mac and Linux.
    
    Stay tuned :)
