# Mounting & Dismounting

## Mounting

This page describes how to mount and dismount OTCamera in the field.

!!! tip "Bring a buddy"

    For mounting the OTCamera in the field its best to get some help.
    We recommend to do the whole mounting process with two persons.

First mount the bracket with the ball head.
Check that the ball head is firmly in place.
The screws on the ball head should be tightened so that it cannot move.
On the back of the outer case you can find a mounting plate that you can slide onto the ball head.
The mounting plate is clamped to the ball head with a screw so that OTCamera is firmly attached to it.

!!! danger

    Make sure that nothing falls down, nobody gets hurt and nothing gets damaged.
    For this purpose, always use and install a drop protection.

Now you can loosen the big screw on the ball head a bit and align the OTCamera to your needs.
You can check the alignment with your mobile phone.
It is best if two people do this.
One person aligns the camera and the other checks the preview.

Always wait a few seconds before adjusting OTCamera again, as a preview image is only generated every few seconds.

??? question "How should I align the camera?"

    We always align OTCamera so that no sky is visible.
    Otherwise, glare can occur and traffic could no longer be seen.
    In addition, there should be enough space in all directions, so that [OTVision](../../OTVision/index.md) can recognize the trajectories of road users sufficiently.

    Please be sure to follow these instructions, especially if you want to automatically process the videos with [OTVision](../../OTVision/index.md) yourself or have us process them for you.

If everything is aligned correctly, you can now lock OTCamera.

Check all the values again on the preview page and make sure that everything is displayed correctly.
Make sure that all screws are tightened and the fall protection is in place.

## Dismounting

When your measurement is finished, you can dismount OTCamera.

Basically, just follow the installation steps in reverse order.
When dismounting, make sure that nothing can drop (as always!).
In particular, opening the screw on the ball head to loosen the mounting plate can cause OTCamera to fall down.
Please take special care that this does not happen.

When everything is dismounted and you are back on the ground, you can open the outer case and set the three right-hand switches (Boot, Wi-Fi, 24/7) to off.

If OTCamera still has power, it will now shut down and indicate this with a rapidly flashing green LED.
If the battery has run down in the meantime, OTCamera has already shut down on its own.
Nevertheless, set all three switches to "0".

??? tip "Turn of all switches!"

    It is sufficient to set the "Boot" switch to "0".
    However, we have made the experience that it is better to make sure that every switch is in the off position.
    Switch on all the switches at the beginning of the measurement and switch them off at the end.
    Then everything is back in the starting position for the next measurement.

When the OTCamera is back in the office, charge the external USB-battery and the OTCamera itself.

Once dismounted, proceed with [Get the Videos](getvideos.md).
