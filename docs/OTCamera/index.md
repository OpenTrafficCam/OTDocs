[OTCamera](https://github.com/OpenTrafficCam/OTCamera) is a mobile camera system for capturing traffic videos.

It is not (really) for sale, but for DIY.
You don't want to build the camera yourself and preferably don't want to have anything to do with the measurement?
Just [write us](mailto:team@opentrafficcam.org).
