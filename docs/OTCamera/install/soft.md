# Soft Version

The soft version of OTCamera can be built completely without soldering skills.
Power is supplied by a StromPi with a dedicated battery pack.
A USB powerbank is plugged into it to maximize the runtime.
The powerbank can be changed during operation without interrupting the recording.
A single power switch is also needed to control startup and shutdown.
The settings of the OTCamera are done via a smartphone using a web interface.

You will need

* a [prepared](gettingstarted.md) [Raspberry Pi Zero WH][zero] (32 Gb High Endurance Micro SD Card recommended)
* [Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2 NoIR][cam]
* [StromPi v3 rev. 1.1][strompi]
* [Battery Unit for StromPi 3][strompibat]
* Switch (for example [Marquardt Rocker Switch 1801][switch])
* USB powerbank (for example [Anker PowerCore 26800][powerbank]
* USB-A to micro-USB cable (should be included with powerbank)
* Housing (for example [Explorer Cases 2712][case]
* 3D printed mounting (comming soon)
* Ballhead to mount and adjust housing (for example Mantona Onyx 12 ballhead (M1-3612A))
* Quick release plate (for example Mantona AS-100-2M quick release plate)
* Mounting equipment to mount ballhead to mast

!!! note
    We have carefully selected all the parts mentioned and also use them ourselves.
    However, in each individual case the parts should be tested before the system is used productively.
    We do not receive any provision from the manufacturers.
    Of course, other parts can also be used.

You should follow the [Getting Started](gettingstarted.md) guide before continuing.
