# First use

After assembling OTCamera on your own or receiving it from us, you can finally start using it!
On this page you will find all the information you need for setting up OTCamera, mounting it, recording videos and downloading them.
If you follow these instructions, you will be good to got to use OTCamera in the field.
The recorded videos can be processed further with [OTVision](/OTVision).

<!-- Further details on the single steps can be found on the following pages. -->

!!! Warning "safety and security"
    Please be aware that your OTCamera can not fall down.
    This applies to the place where it is mounted but also during montage.

    Furthermore, check your local data protection regulations to guarantee you are operating according to the law.
    Depending on the position of the camera, it could be possible that you have to adjust the focus or take further measures.

    Usually you are not allowed to just install an OTCamera in public space and record videos.
    Please make sure you contact the responsible authority and verify whether you need a permission. 

    OTCamera contains a Li-Ion cell and runs with an USB-battery.
    The maximum operating temperature is around 60 degrees Celsius. 
    In warmer regions or on very hot days the ambient temperature in the case may become hotter, especially in direct sunlight.

## Required parts

OTCamera consits of various components:

1. the inner case with th electronic circuit, the switches and the LEDs,
2. an external USB-battery with a cable connected to the inner case,
3. the outer case for weather and theft protection,
4. the ball head with clamp for mounting the OTCamera on a pole.

You may also need the following during mounting:

1. smartphone or tablet to view the preview of OTCamera,
2. a ladder to mount the OTCamera sufficiently high,
3. tools (screwdriver, cordless screwdriver, hexagon socket),
4. a drop guard, to secure OTCamera and the bracket from falling down,
5. a lock to protect against theft,
6. high-visibility clothing for you and your colleagues,
7. the permit for operating in the field.

!!! note
    For preparing the measurement you may need to think about more things than we listed.
    This list is just a reminder that you bear everything in mind.

## Preparation

Before every Measurement you should take care of a few things.
Aditionally to the external USB-battery, OTCamera contains an integrated battery.
Before use, charge the OTCamera and the external USB-battery.
With an 26800 mAh external USB-battery and the integrated battery OTCamera can record up to 3.5 or 4 days in a row.
For example, if you install the OTCamera on monday afternoon, you will have recordings of Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.

!!! tip
    We recommend that every person who needs to mount a OTCamera should practice in a save/"dry" environment beforehand.
    This help to prevent anything going wrong out in the field.

## Installation and measurement

When everything is set up, you are good to go with the preparing of the actual measurement.

Open the outer case, connect the external USB-battery with the inner case and put the external USB-battery in one of the brackets on the right side.
Turn on OTCamera by bringing all the switches in their "on" position.

Now the left green LED lights up permanently and indicates that OTCamera is booting up.
This takes a few tens of seconds.
After booted up, all LEDs turn off shortly and then start flashing.

The power supply over USB is working, when the **green LED** blinks every five seconds for two times.
Blinking only ones means that the power supply works using the internal battery.
Make sure that the USB cable is plugged in correctly on both sides and that the external USB battery is switched on.

The **yellow LED** should blink once every five seconds.
It means that Wi-Fi is switched on permanently.
On the one hand OTCamera conects with your Wi-Fi in the office and you can access OTCamera from your network.
On the other hand OTCamera creates it's own Wi-Fi access point.
The SSID of the access point and the password were set during installation.

The **red LED** should blink once every five seconds.
It means that the camera is currently recording.
Every time the LED blinks a new preview is created.

Everything is working just fine when the green LED blinks twice and the yellow and red LED blink once every five seconds.

You can now connect to the Wi-Fi access point with your smartphone or tablet.
After connecting to the Wi-Fi, you can call up the IP address of OTCamera in a browser, to see the preview.
This is usually [10.10.50.1](http://10.10.50.1).

!!! question "My smartphone will not connect"
    Some smartphones check whether there internet is accessable via Wi-Fi.
    If this is not the case, the smartphone is connected but you cannot access the preview.
    It helps to change the smartphone settings that you want to use the connection anyway.
    Or you can switch off your mobile data and thus force the use of Wi-Fi.

    We therefore use our own tablet without mobile data for our measurements.

You should now see a website with the preview image.
The website automatically reloads every five seconds.
Below the preview image is a table with the most important information.

!!! tip
    If you have already taken several measurements and the memory card is full, at some point the oldest video will be deleted so that recording can continue.

    However, we would still recommend deleting the videos after each measurement. 

At the top of the page you will see a green bar, if everything works fine.
If the camera does not record, the external power supply is not connected or the "24/7" switch is not switched on, a yellow or red bar will appear at the top with a message.

!!! tip
    The camera name and the current time are displayed at the top of the preview image.
    Check the date and time each time you use OTCamera.
    If the time is not correct, the button cell of the real-time clock is probably empty.
    In doubt, hold your mobile phone in the camera image so that you can see the time in the video later.

You can now use the right-hand switch "24/7" to set whether OTCamera should record permanently or only at the configured time of day.

When you switch off the Wi-Fi switch, the yellow LED flashes faster, indicating that the Wi-Fi is about to turn off.
The time until it switches off can be set and is by default 15 minutes.

Now you can close the outer case. Be careful not to pinch the USB cable.
You do not need to open the outer case again.

!!! tip
    We always have extra cables on hand :)

Now you can mount the OTCamera.

!!! tip
    For installing the OTCamera in the field its best to get some help.
    We recommend to do the whole mounting process with two persons.

First mount the bracket with the ball head.
Check that the ball head is firmly in place.
The screws on the ball head should be tightened so that it cannot move.
On the back of the outer case you can find a mounting plate that you can slide onto the ball head.
The mounting plate is clamped to the ball head with a screw so that OTCamera is firmly attached to it.

!!! danger
    Make sure that nothing falls down, nobody gets hurt and nothing gets damaged.
    For this purpose, always use and install a drop protection.

Now you can loosen the big screw on the ball head a bit and align the OTCamera to your needs.
You can check the alignment with your smartphone.
It is best if two people do this.
One person aligns the camera and the other checks the preview.

Always wait a few seconds before adjusting OTCamera again, as a preview image is only generated every five seconds.

!!! tip
    We always align OTCamera so that no sky is visible.
    Otherwise, glare can occur and traffic could no longer be seen.
    In addition, there should be enough space in all directions, so that OTVision can recognize the trajectories of road users sufficiently.

    Please always pay attention to these instructions especially if we should do the processing of the videos for you.

If everything is aligned correctly, you can now lock OTCamera.

Check all the values again on the preview page and make sure that everything is displayed correctly.
Make sure that all screws are tightened and the fall protection is in place.

## Dismounting

When your measurement is finished, you can dismount OTCamera.

Basically, just follow the installation steps in reverse order.
When dismounting, make sure that nothing can drop (as always!).
In particular, opening the screw on the ball head to loosen the mounting plate can cause OTCamera to fall down.
Please take special care that this does not happen.

When everything is dismounted and you are back on the ground, you can open the outer case and set the three right-hand switches (Boot, Wi-Fi, 24/7) to off.

If OTCamera still has power, it will now shut down and indicate this with a rapidly flashing green LED.
If the battery has run down in the meantime, OTCamera has already shut down on its own.
Nevertheless, set all three switches to "0".

!!! note
    It is sufficient to set the "Boot" switch to "0".
    However, we have made the experience that it is better to make sure that every switch is in the off position.
    Switch on all the switches at the beginning of the measurement and switch them off at the end.
    Then everything is back in the starting position for the next measurement.

When the OTCamera is back in the office, charge the external USB-battery and the OTCamera itself.

## Downloading videos

After recharging the battery of the OTCamera you can download the recorded videos.
You have two options:

1. via Wi-Fi and SSH and
2. to a USB flash drive

### Wi-Fi

Turn on OTCamera as described above.
If OTCamera is connected to the Wi-Fi in your office, you can access via SSH using its IP address.
This works the same way as during the installation process.

Alternatively, you can establish a SSH connection using the access point of OTCamera.

By default the recorded videos and logs are stored in the home directory in `~/videos`.
You can download all videos via scp or rsync.

### USB

If you have an OTG USB adapter built into OTCamera, you can also have the videos copied to a flash drive.

Turn off OTCamera completely.
Plug a flash drive in the USB port of OTCamera and turn on OTCamera using the "Boot" switch.
While booting OTCamera checks automatically if an flash drive is plugged in.
If this is not the case, the recording function starts.

OTCamera starts in USB copy mode if a flash drive is connected.
The yellow LED light blinks to indicate that videos are being copied.
If the LED lights up continuously, copying is complete.
In addition, the green LED lights up continuously when you can remove the flash drive.

OTCamera can then be shut down again by switching off the "Boot" switch.

The flash drive now contains all videos and a csv file.
The csv file gives an overview of all videos on OTCamera (not on the flash drive).

When you open the csv file, you can specify that certain videos should be deleted.
Just change the corresponding column and insert an `x` or `true`.

When you save the file and plug the flash drive back into OTCamera,the marked videos will be deleted the next time you boot up.

## Next steps

Now you should have all the videos.
In the next step you can process them with [OTVision](/OTVision).
