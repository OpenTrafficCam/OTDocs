# In a Nutshell

> The **heart** of OpenTrafficCam.

[**OTVision**](https://github.com/OpenTrafficCam/OTVision), is a collection of algorithms to generate trajectories of road users in traffic videos. Most of the algorithms have been developed in previous open source projects. We modify and link them to a working pipeline.

## Key features

* Automated video analysis
* Detection using neural networks
* Can be used without programming knowledge
* Result: Trajectories in image and world coordinates
* Necessary: Windows computer with powerful graphics card (approx. 2.500 â‚¬)

* Conversion of h264 video files to other formats ([ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/))
* Detection (joint localization and classification) of road users in single frames ([YOLOv5 by Jocher/Ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5))
* Tracking of detected road users between single frames ([IOU-Tracker by Bochinski et al.](https://github.com/bochinski/iou-tracker))
* Correction of trajectories for lens distortion ([OpenCV-Library](https://opencv.org/))
* Transformation of trajectories to world coordinates ([OpenCV-Library](https://opencv.org/))
