# Requirements

## Hardware prerequisites

Both OTVision and OTAnalytics run on modern 64 bit Windows 10 desktops and laptops (e.g. i5 processor and 8 GB RAM).

However, if you want to detect road users in videos with OTVision on a regular basis, we strongly recommend purchasing a powerful desktop computer (>= i7, >= 64 GB RAM) with a modern NVidia graphics card (>= GeForce 3070). Make sure that the drivers of the graphics card are installed.
