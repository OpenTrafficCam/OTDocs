# Configuration

> **configure** it for your own needs

**OTVision** can be configured to your own needs providing a `yaml` file. By default, **OTVision** refers to the `user_config.otvision.yaml` in the base directory. 

!!! info "It is highly recommended not to modify the default config file."
    Instead, please make a copy of the default config file and modify it to your own needs. The config files can be passed to the convert, detect and track functions seperately.
