# Getting Started

> Become a part of Open**Traffic**Cam

We are happy if you contribute your own code to OpenTrafficCam.
This can be bugfixes in the current code, or even completely new stuff.
It is best to start at [GitHub](github.md) to get a first overview.

We are also happy to receive reports about the experience using OpenTrafficCam.
If you find a bug in the software or the documentation, please report it as an issue in the corresponding repository on GitHub or via email.

From time to time we are looking to expand the team behind OpenTrafficCam.
So if you are an enthusiastic developer or engineer who has programming experience and would like to work at the intersection of mobility analysis and planning,
software and hardware, feel free to get in touch :)

If you have any questions, feel free to send us an [email](mailto:team@opentrafficcam.org).
