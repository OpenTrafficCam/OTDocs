# Extend COCO

If you want to extend datasets to retrain models, the format of your new labels should be conform to those of the original dataset.

We want to extend the MS COCO dataset of 2D bounding boxes with our own labels in frames from our sample videos. For this purpose, annotators are provided with pre-labeled detections using YOLOv5x. In these, they will check classification and positional accuracy of 2D boxes just for a defined set of object classes.

On this page we define our intended organizational and technical annotation workflow using CVAT.

## Annotation Workflow in CVAT

### Projects, Tasks and Jobs

We define certain set of videos as a **project**.
Every project has multiple **tasks** (each consists of one video to annotate). Each task has a status ("Pending", "In Progress" and "Completed") and a progress bar showing the number of completed jobs. Open the task with klick on "Open".  
For each task (or video) multiple **jobs** with a certain amounts of frames from the video are defined. Each job has a status ("annotation", "validation" and "completed"), an "assignee" (responsible for annotation) and a "reviewer" (responsible for reviewing the assignees annotation). Open the job with klick on "Job #...".

### Macro Workflow

For each job, the project coordinator assigns the roles of the "assignee" (= annotator) and the "reviewer". The reviewer then starts working on a job by initial labeling (see [Annotation](#annotation)) of the video frames. The assignee should save his labeling work from time to time and can also stop and later repeat working on a job. After finishing the initial labeling, the assignee requests a review (menu - request review, the assigned reviewer should already be named there) and thus sets status of the job to "validation".Then the reviewer checks the initial labeling done by the assignee and raises issues when there is a problem or question. After reviewing all video frames of the job, the reviewer submits the review (see see [Review](#review) by either accepting and completing the job or rejecting it (which sets the status of the job bach to "Annotation"). Now the assignee has to check the issues, update the labels, resolve the issus and again request a review. The review process starts again and if necessary also next annotations, until the reviewer accepts the job and it is marked as "Completed".

### Micro Workflow

#### Annotation

The following procedure is defined for annotation in CVAT:

- Go through all pre-labeled objects on the right
  - Check and delete false positive labels (if there is no object)
  - Check and delete duplicate labels for the same object
  - Check and correct object class for target classes
  - Check and delete objects from other classes if they are classified wrong
- Zoom in on one quadrant of the image at a time:
  - Check and correct position of objectÂ´s 2D boxes
  - Check if there are objects from the target classes not already pre-labeled, draw new 2D box and annotate object class

#### Review

## Project specific instructions

### Target classes

Target classes are all road user classes from the initial COCO data set that are relevant for our sample videos:

- Person
- Bicycle
- Motorcycle
- Car
- Bus
- Truck

All vehicles or combinations of vehicles are labeled as "truck" if they have

- twin tires (except for regular service buses or coaches),
- a superstructure or a loading area or
- a trailer (also cars with trailer, the 2D box includes vehicle and trailer).

Here, as in the COCO dataset, both the "person" and the "bicycle" are labeled separately for bicyclists.

### Object dimensions

The 2D box boundaries are defined by the outermost parts of the objects visible in that frame of the video.

Even if only a part of an object is visible and the class of the object is recognizable for the annotator, it should be labeled.

Labeling is done under [label.opentrafficcam.org](https://label.opentrafficcam.org). Accounts and jobs for labeling and review are administrated by the OpenTrafficCam [core developers](mailto:team@opentrafficcam.org). Annotators will also find assistance in the [CVAT user guide](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/cvat/blob/develop/cvat/apps/documentation/user_guide.md).
