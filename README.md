# Documentation of OpenTrafficCam

This repository provides the [full documentation for OpenTrafficCam](opentrafficcam.org).

It is generated by [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) using the awesome [material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme.

The documentation is fully written in [Markdown](https://python-markdown.github.io/).


## Setup

MkDocs is a python based static site generator. You'll need a running python environment to build the documentation.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenTrafficCam/OTDocs
pip install --user -r .\requirements.txt
```

## Contribute

You can run a local server with autoload to contribute on the documentation (you could use ```mkdocs serve``` if you added python to systems PATH):

```bash
python -m mkdocs serve
```

MkDocs builds all content in ```/docs``` and starts a local webserver which monitors for changes.

Open [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) in your browser to access this site. If you change any file inside ```/docs``` MkDocs regenerates that site and instantly reloads your browser.

A ton of additional markdown features are documented in the material theme [reference](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/abbreviations/).

To extend or change the navigation or change settings of the theme have look at the ```mkdocs.yml```.

If you are using VS Code you should consider using the extension [markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint) to write proper markdown code. [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one) could be useful to write markdown.

You can commit any changes in any branch except master.

## Deploy

The public [documentation](https://opentrafficcam.org) is hosted on GitHub Pages and will be deployed automatically. 
To add your changes to the official documentation just open a pull request to master. After a review a GitHub action will deploy the changes.
