# Documentation of OpenTrafficCam

This repository provides the [full documentation for OpenTrafficCam](https://opentrafficcam.org).

It is generated by [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) using the awesome [material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme.

The documentation is fully written in [Markdown](https://python-markdown.github.io/).

## Contribute

You can update or correct the content of this documentation by editing existing or creating new Markdown files in ```/docs``` (e.g. directly on GitHub or using an IDE like VS Code).
A new page needs to be added to the navigation structure in ```mkdocs.yml```.
It includes also all settings for the theme.

If you are using VS Code you should consider using the extension [markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint) to write proper Markdown code.
The [YAML] extension is useful to to lint and autoformat the ```mkdocs.yml``` .
[Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one) could be helpful to write Markdown.

You can commit any changes in any branch except `master` and `gh-pages`.
To add your changes, create a new branch and open a pull request to `master`.
`gh-pages` branch contains the generated HTML files for the site and should never be touched.

A ton of additional Markdown features are documented in the material theme [reference](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/abbreviations/).

## Deploy

### Site

MkDocs converts all Markdown files using the settings and navigation defined in ```mkdocs.yml``` into a static HTML site.
The [documentation](https://opentrafficcam.org) is hosted on GitHub Pages and will be deployed automatically.
After creating, reviewing and merging a pull request to the master branch, a GitHub action will deploy the changes.

### Local Sneak Preview

If you want to preview your changes before creating a pull request, here is what you have to do.

Clone the repository (if not done already).
Create a virtual environment and install dependencies.

```bash
sh ./install_dev.sh
```

You can run a local server with autoload.
You should always upgrade your venv since the GitHub Pages deployment always uses the most current versions.

```bash
sh ./start_local_server.sh
```

MkDocs builds the site and starts a local webserver which monitors for changes.

Open [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) in your browser to access this site.
If you change any file inside ```/docs``` MkDocs regenerates that site and instantly reloads your browser.
This even works great if you change a branche while running ```mkdocs serve``` .

To stop the web server, type "Ctrl + C" .
The virtual environment can then be closed with the following command.

```bash
deactivate
```
